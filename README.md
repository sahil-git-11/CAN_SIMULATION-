A virtual CAN bus environment that performs the following:

1 . Message Transmission and Reception: Simulate the behavior of sending and receiving CAN messages, where each message consists of an arbitration ID and an 8-byte data payload.

2 . Anomaly Detection: Implement a mechanism to detect unauthorized message IDs and abnormal data patterns within received messages.

3 .Testing and Validation: Incorporate intentional anomalies (e.g., unauthorized IDs or data exceeding thresholds) to test the robustness of the anomaly detection system.
